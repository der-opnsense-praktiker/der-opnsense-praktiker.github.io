Security Issues for Host 10.4.1.7
---------------------------------

Issue
-----
NVT:    http TRACE XSS attack
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.11213
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 5.8)
Port:   80/tcp

Summary:
Debugging functions are enabled on the remote HTTP server.
The remote webserver supports the TRACE and/or TRACK methods. TRACE and TRACK
are HTTP methods which are used to debug web server connections.   
It has been shown that servers supporting this method are subject to
cross-site-scripting attacks, dubbed XST for Cross-Site-Tracing, when
used in conjunction with various weaknesses in browsers. 
An attacker may use this flaw to trick your legitimate web users to give
him their credentials.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Solution: 
Add the following lines for each virtual host in your configuration file :
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^(TRACE|TRACK)
    RewriteRule .* - [F]
See also http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/de/mod/core.html#traceenable

Solution:
Disable these methods.

NVT:    SSH Weak Encryption Algorithms Supported
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.105611
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 4.3)
Port:   22/tcp

Summary:
The remote SSH server is configured to allow weak encryption algorithms.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The following weak client-to-server encryption algorithms are supported by the r!
emote service:
3des-cbc
aes128-cbc
aes192-cbc
aes256-cbc
arcfour
arcfour128
arcfour256
blowfish-cbc

arcfour
arcfour128
arcfour256
blowfish-cbc
cast128-cbc
rijndael-cbc@lysator.liu.se

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Disable the weak encryption algorithms.

Vulnerability Insight:
The `arcfour` cipher is the Arcfour stream cipher with 128-bit keys.
  The Arcfour cipher is believed to be compatible with the RC4 cipher [SCHNEIER]!
.  Arcfour (and RC4) has problems
  with weak keys, and should not be used anymore.
  The `none` algorithm specifies that no encryption is to be done.
  Note that this method provides no confidentiality protection, and it
  is NOT RECOMMENDED to use it.
  A vulnerability exists in SSH messages that employ CBC mode that may allow an !
attacker to recover plaintext from a block of ciphertext.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Check if remote ssh service supports Arcfour, none or CBC ciphers.

Issue

NVT:    A CVS pserver is running
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.10051
Threat: Low (CVSS: 3.3)
Port:   2401/tcp

Summary:
A CVS (Concurrent Versions System) server is installed, and it is configured
to have its own password file, or use that
of the system. This service starts as a daemon, listening on port
TCP:port.
Knowing that a CVS server is present on the system gives attackers
additional information about the system, such as that this is a
UNIX based system, and maybe a starting point for further attacks.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Vulnerability was detected according to the Vulnerability Detection Method.

Solution:
Block those ports from outside communication

Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.6)
Port:   22/tcp

Summary:
The remote SSH server is configured to allow weak MD5 and/or 96-bit MAC algorith!
ms.

Vulnerability Detection Result:

ervice:
hmac-md5

Issue

NVT:    TCP timestamps
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.80091
Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.6)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps and therefore allows to compute
  the uptime.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
It was detected that the host implements RFC1323.
The following timestamps were retrieved with a delay of 1 seconds in-between:
Packet 1: 869879
Packet 2: 870965

Impact:
A side effect of this feature is that the uptime of the remote
  host can sometimes be computed.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
To disable TCP timestamps on linux add the line 'net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0' to
  /etc/sysctl.conf. Execute 'sysctl -p' to apply the settings at runtime.
  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timesta!
mps=disabled'
  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be complete!
ly disabled.
  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the
  Timestamp options when initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP pee!
r
  that is initiating communication includes them in their synchronize (SYN) segm!
ent.

Affected Software/OS:
TCP/IPv4 implementations that implement RFC1323.

Vulnerability Insight:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps, as defined by RFC1323.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Special IP packets are forged and sent with a little delay in between to the
  target IP. The responses are searched for a timestamps. If found, the timestam!
ps are reported.
